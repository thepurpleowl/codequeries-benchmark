You are an expert software developer. Please help identify the results of evaluating the CodeQL query titled "{{ query_name }}" on a code snippet. The results should be given as code spans or fragments (if any) from the code snippet. The description of the CodeQL query "{{ query_name }}" is - {{ description }}


If there are spans that match the query description, print them out one per line. If no spans matching the query description are present, say N/A.


The following are some examples of code snippets with and without spans matching the query description.
Example code snippet with span(s) matching the query description
```python
{{ positive_context }}
```


Code span(s)
```python
{% for span in positive_spans %}
{{span}}
{% endfor %}
```


Example code snippet with no span(s) matching the query description
```python
{{ negative_context }}
```


Code span(s)
```python
N/A
```


Code snippet
```python
{{ input_code }}
```
